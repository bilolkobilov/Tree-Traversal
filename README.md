# 🌳 Tree Traversal Master

An interactive web application for visualizing, analyzing, and manipulating tree data structures.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic rendering with multiple input methods
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Preorder, inorder, postorder, and level-order with animated execution
- **Tree Analysis**: Check properties (BST, balanced, complete), calculate metrics (height, depth, size)
- **Advanced Operations**: Transform trees, find LCA, calculate max path sum
- **Import/Export**: Support for JSON, CSV, PNG, and PDF formats

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Visualization: vis.js Network
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Additional: Chart.js, html2canvas, jsPDF, Font Awesome

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Open `deep.html` in any modern browser
2. Load a tree using manual entry, graphical builder, file import, or samples
3. Run traversals, analyze properties, and apply transformations
4. Export results as needed

## 🎯 Ideal For

- Computer science students learning tree concepts
- Educators demonstrating algorithms
- Engineers testing implementations
- Interview preparation
- Algorithm enthusiasts
