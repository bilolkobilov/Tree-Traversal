- **Multiple Input Methods**: Manual entry, graphical builder, file import, and sample trees
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size with a modern UI

### 🔍 Comprehensive Traversal Algorithms
- **Standard Traversals**: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order
- **Animated Execution**: Visualize each step with color-coded nodes and paths
- **Path Highlighting**: See exactly how the algorithm navigates the tree

### 📊 Advanced Tree Analysis
- **Structural Properties**: Check if tree is BST, Balanced, Complete, or Full
- **Measurements**: Calculate height, depth, size, leaf count, and diameter
- **Statistics**: Min/max values, sum, and average of node values

### 🛠️ Powerful Operations
- **Transformations**: Mirror, rotate, flatten, and prune trees
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Find Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), paths, and max path sum
- **Graphical Editing**: Add/remove nodes and edges with intuitive controls

### 📁 Import/Export Capabilities
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON and CSV file support
- **Export Options**: Save as PNG, PDF, or JSON for documentation
- **Sample Trees**: Preloaded examples including Binary, N-ary, AVL, and Red-Black trees

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
